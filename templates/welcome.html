    <p>While we not so patiently await the arrival of the new baby, we thought we could have a bit of fun with the waiting and wondering game. While you wait, take some time to place bets on any and all possibile characteristics of the baby! Currently there are 7 data points you can bet on - the baby's birth date, birth time, birth weight, birth length, birth hair, first name initial and middle name initial. In order to secure your bet for each aspect, accompany your bet with a unique email (all of your bets will be referenced by this email), then place the bets you would like to make. Each bet must be accompanied by a $2 payment to the administrator in order to be eligible for winning. Make sure you give the money for each bet you place to the administrator. When the baby arrives the winners will get 50% of the total amount paid in for the bet, divided equally among all winners. The remaining 50% will go to the new parents of the baby! (unless of course you'd like to purchase a diaper or two for the new parents with your winnings, we can arrange that too, I'm sure they will need it!). Winners will be emailed once the answers are known! This is all for fun to pass the time, so join us and enjoy the wait! </p>
